# 5 Day Forecast

# Description
This webpage can be used as a tool for the user to search any city in the United States and have the current weather in that city displayed and the following 5 days of the predicted weather be displayed  underneath the current day. Along with the weather forecast each day will also include the temperature in fahrenheit, the wind speed in miles per hour, and the humidity percentage for that day.

# How To Use
The user upon loading the webpage will be presented with an almost empty page that includes a search bar and a search button. The user will enter the desired US city in the search bar and when they click on the search button they will be presented with the current days weather in that city as well as the following five day forecast for that specific city. The users search history will be saved as buttons that appear underneath the previously used search bar and button. If the user clicks on the newly created searched city history button the page will reload the five day forecast for that city again. If the user refreshes the page the search history and displayed forecast will be wiped clean and present a fresh start for the user.
